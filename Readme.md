## 🚀 Introduction

In this cycle of attention that generates money, there should be **no centralized entity** acting as a trusted intermediary for incentivizing on-chain users. Our solution introduces **Verifiable Kaito**, a decentralized mechanism that assigns **Yaps** to **CT Yapsters** in a **fully transparent and verifiable** manner. By leveraging **ERC-7007** and **ORA.io opML**, we eliminate the need for centralized trust and ensure fair distribution of Yaps.

## 🔥 The Problem
- Today's Yap assignments depend on **centralized databases and opaque algorithms**.
- "Trust me, bro" is the norm—users have no way to **verify distributions**.
- The system disproportionately favors **ASS-licking top CT performers**, reinforcing bias and harming the CT ecosystem.

## 🛠 The Solution: Verifiable Kaito
We maintain the **same fun, engaging experience** but with one **game-changing difference**: **complete verifiability**. If anyone has doubts, they can **verify any user's Yaps** using our **verifiable agent**.

### 🔗 Powered By:
- **[ERC-7007](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7007)**: Enables fully transparent, on-chain incentives.
- **[ORA.io opML](https://ora.io/)**: Ensures trustless AI-powered validation.

## 🧐 Don't Trust—Verify Everything
**Attention is money.**

By leveraging cryptographic proofs and smart contracts, we empower users to **audit Yap distributions** at any time. No more bias, no more trust-based allocation—just pure verifiability.
