In this cycle of attention that generates money, there should be no way for a centralized entity to act as a trusted intermediary for incentivizing on-chain users. Our solution is a type of verifiable Kaito that assigns Yaps to CT Yapsters in a fully verifiable manner.

The current problem is that all Yaps assigned today rely on a "trust me, bro" approach, stored in a centralized database and backend, which harms the overall CT ecosystem. This system favors ASS-licking top CT performers on Kaito, reinforcing bias.

Our solution maintains the same vibe, but with a crucial difference: if anyone has doubts, they can verify any user's Yaps using a verifiable agent that leverages the ERC-7007 standard and ORA.io opML.

Don’t trust—verify everything, Attention is money.
