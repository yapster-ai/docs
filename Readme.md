## 🚀 Introduction

In this cycle of attention that generates money, there should be **no centralized entity** acting as a trusted intermediary for incentivizing on-chain users. Our solution introduces **Verifiable Kaito**, a decentralized mechanism that assigns **Yaps** to **CT Yapsters** in a **fully transparent and verifiable** manner. By leveraging **ERC-7007** and **ORA.io opML**, we eliminate the need for centralized trust and ensure fair distribution of Yaps.

## 🔥 The Problem
- Today's Yap assignments depend on **centralized databases and opaque algorithms**.
- "Trust me, bro" is the norm—users have no way to **verify distributions**.
- The system disproportionately favors **ASS-licking top CT performers**, reinforcing bias and harming the CT ecosystem.

## 🛠 The Solution: Verifiable Kaito
We maintain the **same fun, engaging experience** but with one **game-changing difference**: **complete verifiability**. If anyone has doubts, they can **verify any user's Yaps** using our **verifiable agent**.

### 🔗 Powered By:
- **[ERC-7007](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7007)**: Enables fully transparent, on-chain incentives.
- **[ORA.io opML](https://ora.io/)**: Ensures trustless AI-powered validation.

## 🧐 Don't Trust—Verify Everything
**Attention is money.**

By leveraging cryptographic proofs and smart contracts, we empower users to **audit Yap distributions** at any time. No more bias, no more trust-based allocation—just pure verifiability.

## 🚀 Get Started
- **Client App**: [Live Demo](https://www.yapster.ai/) , [Github](https://github.com/yapster-ai/client)
- **Twitter Interaction**: [Github](https://github.com/yapster-ai/x-interactions)
- **Smart Contracts**: [Github](https://github.com/yapster-ai/contracts)

## **How Yapster Works**

### **Step 1: User Authentication**
- Users log in to **Yapster.ai** using their **X (Twitter) account**.
- Once authenticated, Yapster begins tracking and evaluating **engagement on their tweets**.

### **Step 2: Minting Social Profile as an NFT**
- Users mint their **social profile as an NFT**, which serves as a **verifiable identity** for engagement tracking.
- Yapster AI assigns **Yap Points** based on the user's activity.

### **Step 3: Yap Score Calculation**
- Yapster AI fetches the user's **latest tweets and engagement data**.
- The AI model evaluates the tweets based on:
  - **Engagement (likes, retweets, replies)**
  - **Relevance to current CT trends**
  - **Originality and influence**
- **A score is assigned to each tweet**, and the total score is updated.

### **Step 4: Verifiable Storage on ERC-7007 NFT**
- The updated Yap score is stored as **metadata on an ERC-7007 NFT**.
- This allows anyone to **verify** the engagement and influence **on-chain**.
- The metadata follows **ERC-7007 JSON Schema** for standardization.

### **Step 5: Fraud-Proof Verification via ORA.io opML**
- Yapster integrates **ORA.io's opML** to ensure **AI model integrity**.
- This prevents manipulation by providing **fraud-proof verification** of Yap scores.

### **ERC-7007 Standard**
- Yapster utilizes **ERC-7007**, an extension of **ERC-721**, to store **AI-generated engagement scores**.
- The NFT metadata contains:
  - **Name & Description**
  - **Engagement Data**
  - **Proof of Authenticity** (via zkML/opML)

### **Verifiable AI Agent**
- AI models process engagement data **off-chain**.
- Results are validated through **optimistic ML fraud proofs**.
- Verified engagement is appended to **on-chain metadata**.

### **Yapster Contracts**
- **Yaps.sol**: Stores mapping of **user profiles → Yap trees & scores**.
- **ERC7007.sol**: Implements NFT metadata updates & verification.
- **Oracle.sol**: Handles AI model requests and fraud-proof validation.

## **Why Yapster Matters**

🔹 **No more centralized manipulation** – Yaps are verifiable, removing bias from engagement metrics.
🔹 **True Proof-of-Attention** – Every engagement is **tokenized and stored on-chain**.
🔹 **Fraud-Proof AI Model** – Ensures AI-generated engagement scores **cannot be tampered with**.
